# 40days

This application is a simple web page app to show you what date it is
40 (or any number) in the future.

It is written using [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [scss](http://sass-lang.com/).

## Demo

You can see it in action at [docwhat.github.io/40days](http://docwhat.github.io/40days/).
